Hi Etsy! Thanks for taking the time to check out my website. It's called Etsy Outfits, and is used for creating and saving your own Etsy outfits. I made it using PHP and JavaScript (with JQuery and JQuery UI) using the CodeIgniter framework for PHP, DataMapper ORM, and MySQL database. In the future I plan to get full production access so I can use OAuth to add the outfit items to a customer's store, favorites items or treasury list. Please let me know if you have any questions.
